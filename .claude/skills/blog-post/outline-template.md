## Structural Notes

[Meta-notes about the post's construction: how concepts are sequenced,
how the running example threads through sections, where `<details>` blocks
are used, section transition patterns, etc. These help the writer and
reviewers understand the outline's design decisions.]

- [Note about pedagogical sequencing]
- [Note about running example threading]
- [Note about `<details>` placement rationale]

## Reference Notes

[Background research and context for the writer to draw on when drafting.
Not for publication. Use when a topic needs extensive context that would
clutter the outline itself (e.g., evolving technical landscape, timeline
data, multi-source synthesis).]
